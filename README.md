# Gedalya's Unit 1 Project: Portfolio Update v1

I have tested both pages in Firefox, Safari and Chrome and it checks out on my end.

As-per the project instructions, I did not segment the CSS and secondary HTML files into their own folders. Only the image assets are in their own folder.

My goal in this project is to meet the extra credit "Exceeds Expectations" requirements. In this effort, I tried to align the colors with my personal brand, added a new page/images and updated various aspects of the CSS.
